lunch-options
=============

This is a Java program that calculates the lowest cost to purchase a desired combination of items for lunch.

The input file contains a list of restaurant combos and prices. The last line in the file contains the combination of items that you want to buy. It is ok if extra items are purchased, as long as your purchase contains all of the items in last line of the file. 

The output file will contain the name of the restaurant with the lowest cost to purchase the desired items, and the total cost to buy those items.

To run this program, run the LunchOptions Java class, passing the absolute path of the input file as the first parameter to main(), and the absolute path of the output file as the second parameter.

For example, you could run the following from the command line:
java LunchOptions C:\Users\Eric\workspace\Lunch_options\input.csv C:\Users\Eric\workspace\Lunch_options\output.csv
